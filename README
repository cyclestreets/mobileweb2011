Mobile HTML version of CycleStreets - in beta.

Created using jQuery Mobile.

Uses experimental crosshairs feature.

TODO (order of priority):

* Add geolocation for photo uploads.
* Check user is in UK, fail gracefully otherwise. 
* Use 'heading' feature in geolocation to display the user's direction of travel.
* Add support for offline routes with cache-manifest (if we can cache map tiles in sufficient numbers).
